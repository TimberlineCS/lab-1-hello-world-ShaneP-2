## Your Tasks

- [ ] Write a program that prints an ascii art to the console. Follow this link to get some inspiration,
https://text-symbols.com/ascii-art/

- [ ] At the top of the file, before your class declaration use comments to indicate the following on separate lines

  * Your name
  * Course
  * Date
  * Inside the main method of your program use block quotes to write a comment that describes the ascii art you created.

- [ ] Once you have completed the above be sure to push your changes to your AP Computer Science A Repo to GitHub
